Macro to parse QUshape output and generate reactivties in function of the nucleotide nature.

Parameters can me modified via Macro_Qushape.Config

[Conditions]
Nucleotides: C,G
# nucleotide nature to be considered for the normalization, nucleotides should be separated by','
Lowervalue=-0.3 
# The highest value for non validated reactivity value
Threshold=0.2
# The average distance between two values from individuel experiment.
Desactiv_threshold=0.6
# The reativity value from which the previous filetring by threshold is no more applied. 

#############Rules for calculation:
# if at least two values in the set are equal to -10 , return -10 as average value.
# if only one value equals to -10 , the mean is calculated from the other remaining values 
Get couple of 2 by 2 values then calculate their distance to chek if there is one distance above the 'Threshold'.
This filter is applied only for values below 'Desactiv_threshold'.

Input:  QU-shape-output folder, the required format for files is RNA_reagent_number.txt 
       an example of input data (mSP rna with 3 probing data is provided)

To launch the program: 
python2.7 Macro_Qushape.py

Output: 
CE_reactivity_profiles contain the normalized reactivities for different experiments.
Reactivity: contain final reactivities by RNA and reagent.
