Macro_CE allows to parse QUshape output and generate reactivties in function of the nucleotide nature.

Parameters can be set/modified through the file Macro_Qushape.Config as follow:

[Program]
Task: 2
==> The program by default performs normalization
if Task set to 2, the reactivity average calculation is performed in addition.

[Paths]
InputFile: Qu-shape-output
Iofile_Extenstion: txt
Outputreactivityfile: CE_reactivity_profiles

[Normalization]
Method: 
==> For short RNA (length<=300 bps) [resp.long RNA (length>300 bps] the Norm1 (Norm2) is set by default. 
The user can also either choose Norm1 or Norm2.
Norm1: The 2% of the most reactive peaks are removed. The normalization term correponds to the average
of the next 8% of the most reactive peaks.
Norm2: Quantile normalization
Reactivity values above 1.5 times the interquartile range are removed.
Then, the 10% of the highest remaining reactivities are averaged to serve as a nomalization term.

[Conditions]
Nucleotides: G,C
==> Specify nucleotides to be considered for the normalization, if empty all nuclotides are selected by default.
 nucleotides should be separated by ','
 
Nucreadout: A,C
==> Specify the nucleotides to be read out, if empty the reactivity will be calculated for all nucleotides by default.

Lowervalue: -0.3 
==>The max value for null normalized values.

Threshold=0.2
==>The average distance between two values from individuel experiment.

Desactiv_threshold=0.6
==> The reativity value from which the previous filetring by threshold is no more applied. 

############# Rules for reactivity calculation:
# if at least two values in the set are equal to -10 , return -10 as average value.
# if only one value equals to -10 , the mean is calculated from the other remaining values 
Get couple of 2 by 2 values then calculate their distance to chek if there is one distance above the 'Threshold'.
This filter is applied only for values below 'Desactiv_threshold'.

Input:  QU-shape-output folder, the required format for files is RNA_reagent_number.txt 
       an example of input data (mSP rna with 3 probing data is provided)

To launch the program: 
python2.7 Macro_Qushape.py

Output: 
CE_reactivity_profiles contain the normalized reactivities for different experiments.
Reactivity: contain final reactivities by RNA and reagent.
