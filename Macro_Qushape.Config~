Macro to parse QUshape output and generate reactivties in function of the nucleotide nature.

[Paths]
InputFile: Qu-shape-output
Iofile_Extenstion: txt
Outputreactivityfile: CE_reactivity_profiles

[Conditions]
Nucleotides: C,G
# nucleotide nature to be considered for the normalization, nucleotides should be separated by','
Lowervalue=-0.3 
# The highest value for non validated reactivity value
Threshold=0.2
# The average distance between two values from individuel experiment.
Desactiv_threshold=0.6
# The reativity value from which the previous filetring by threshold is no more applied.
